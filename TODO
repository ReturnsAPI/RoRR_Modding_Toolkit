v Add Equipment class
    v Modify Actor and Item onEquipmentUse callbacks
- Add ability for specific (single-instance) Actor callbacks
- Add Item and Equipment toggle_loot
- Add new custom Object support (based on info from sarn)
- Add Difficulty class
o Apply Instance wrapper everywhere (on gm.array_get, etc.)
    : Support on GM instance variable get/set; having only this is probably fine
