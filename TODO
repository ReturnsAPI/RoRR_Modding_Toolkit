- : todo
v : completed
o : implemented differently


v Add Equipment class
    v Modify Actor and Item onEquipmentUse callbacks
- Add ability for specific (single-instance) Actor callbacks
v Add Item and Equipment toggle_loot
v Add new custom Object support (based on info from sarn)
- Add Difficulty class
o Apply Instance wrapper everywhere (on gm.array_get, etc.)
    : Support on GM instance variable get/set; having only this is probably fine
    ! EDIT: See Notes.txt
o Fix actor:fire_explosion not stunning without proc being active, which makes no sense
v Add Instance.spawn_crate back

- Add actor:reduce_cooldown(slot)
o Also think of better way to do cooldown reduction on a slot (I think Hardlight Afterburner already does this)

o Overwrite fire_bullet and fire_explosion to guarantee stun application
- Might need to change onHit to a different hook to pass in a modifiable attack_info (maybe)

v actor:fire_explosion rewrite

v ISSUE: onPostStatRecalc is called immediately after onStatRecalc for each module separately
    v Will have to move around onPostStatRecalc to a single function or something

v Add actor:get_active_skill(slot)
- Add tracers for actor:fire_bullet()

v Add interactable cards for Interactable
- Add Interactable_Crate class (for custom interactables that use the command crate window)
    - Can reuse Interactable Instance from Interactable
    - Actually could probably work into Interactable with a bit of tweaking

v Add Damager wrapper

v Allow actor:fire_direct to accept x and y pos
- Add tracer_kind to actor:fire_bullet (and an enum for it)

- Add secondary argument for weights for item:get_random
